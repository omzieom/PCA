Tasks and questions:

Perform a principle component analysis (PCA)
How many components will you choose based on an explained variance ratio of your choice? 
Plot the proportion of explained variance and the number of components.

Using the selected number of components, find which features of the original data have the highest absolute correlation with each of the components
Select features with absolute correlation with the PCA components of at least 0.75.
How many and which features will you end up with?
